Applications and libraries required to be a developer for this project. I will be updating this list as necessary.

 - Latest java JDK, it is currently version 8. - http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html (Please talk to me if you don't know how to add paths to your System Variables)

 - libgdx - http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/download.html "Download setup App"
 - Strongly recommended, Genymotion. This is a 3rd party emulator for testing android applications. The default emulator included with Android Studio is slow and horrible. As stated below, if you want Genymotion, you will also need to download VirtualBox. I cannot stress enough how useful this tool is, and it's very easy to setup. Genymotion won't allow you to download from their website unless you make account. It's free and takes about 2 minutes. - https://www.genymotion.com/#!/download

If you want to use Genymotion
  -Get VirtualBox
  -Get Genymotion
  -Search for "Genymotion" in Android Studio > Settings > Plugins > Browse Repositories

We will most likely be using the libgdx game development library. This is a very popular library used for developing games on various platforms. Not to mention, it's free. Documentation - https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki
I am using the following project to help us with our project and code structure. Android applications have a lot of files, and they all need to be in the correct directories/sub-directories. Feel free to look around in it, and as always, ask me questions if you have any. https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx-demo-superjumper
